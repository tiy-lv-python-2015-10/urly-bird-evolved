# Urly Bird Evolved

## Description

The urly-bird assignment was all well and good but not good enough.  No one wants
to use sites that are unstyled (except maybe craigslist).  This assignment is
all about beautification of that assignment.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment you should be able to:
* Successfully integrate static files into django
* Understand how to avoid checking in system files
* Use custom css or bootstrap to style an existing project

## Details

### Deliverables
* Pull request to a Django Project

### Requirements
* Implement all features
* Complete tests
* No systems files
* No pep8 errors

## Normal Mode
Take the Urly Bird assignment from last weekend and style it with bootstrap
DO NOT USE django-bootstrap.

* Do not check in any systems files (.idea, .pyc)
* Create a base template that the others will extend from
* All pages should be styled
* Forms should use bootstrap styling
* Create a profile page for users that shows just their bookmarks as well as
their profile information.

## Hard Mode
* Use [gravitar](https://en.gravatar.com) to automatically give them a profile picture
* Create a page for the most popular links. This page should have different time
options to filter the links by
  * Most popular in the past day
  * Most popular in the last week
  * Most popular ever

## Nightmare Mode
* Don't use bootstrap
